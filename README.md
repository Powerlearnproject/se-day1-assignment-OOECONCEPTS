Software Engineering Day1 Assignment
Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering


Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering  is an organised engineering principle of from bring technological concept from the ideation level to reality. these processes includes:
1. Designing
2. Development
3. Testing
4. Deployment.
5. Maintenance


The importance involves a critical and ordered approach of creating software application and systems in order to solve life needs in health, transporation, agriculture,bsuiness and finance sector and world


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The first is the emergence of digital computer system in the 1940s
the development of programming languages
the establishment of software engineering is in the 1960s



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Gathering requirement involves getting a first hand information about what the user needs and wants. The people to use. How it is going to be accessed.
Designing: the creation of the blueprint of how to application is going to look like at the end of the development and the user interface, designing how data will be stored.

Development: this is the process of programming using your programming language inorder to create the application tailored according the customer or User's needs.

Testing: this involves a critical approach of testing the application in line with the user specificartions. Which can be done in Units, modules and whole.

Deployment: This is delivery process of uploading the application for easy accessibilty in order for the user to gain access to it.

Maintenance: This is the stage of fixing bugs, errors, resolving users' complain and improving the application.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Water fall is approach that goes in descending order. For examples the process of creation a Payment gateway for a Fashion House will be in this manner:Gatehring requirement, designing, development, testing and deployment and maintenence

Agile is a methodology  that is active in its approach. It is progressive method of creating a solution that is iterative and collaborative.
E.g A Business ventures needs an application to




Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
The role of a Software developer is to create a solution( design,code, test, deploy and maintain)that is tailored with the specification 
of the Customer or User using the software engineering principles. Also collaborating with the team members.

Quality Assurance Engineer is responsible for checking that the created solution is void of bugs(testing), errors and ambiguity. Also checks for consistency
 with the Users' stated specifications.

Project manager is the person who is overseeing the project from the inception to the delivery of the solution.
From the point of gatherting information to the maintenance level.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE is programming interface that offers both Graphical user intyerface experience and command line experience for the user. It also offer services like to write,
debug and test codes. e.g Netbeans, Eclipse etc.

Version control System is tracking system that helps in recording the operations and activities that was done to a file, project
 and other per time.It also aids cordination work among team members. e.g Git,Subversion....



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
There are quite a few challenges. They include: 
1. The frustration of customers' change in the stated documentation after the deployment
2. Meeting deadlines
3. Collaborating with inefficient team members

Ensuring that the Customers vision and perception is captured during the Information gathering stage.
Prepare sudden changes that was not stated in the project scope during the maintenance level.

Follwing strictly to the organised time scheldule for each project module and escalate when confronted with a challenge
Play the role of the inefficient team member if possible in order to make expected progress. And finding a way to foster collaboration with such colleague




Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is a kind of testing that involves checking for each module in the application is void of errors
Integration testing is checking the interaction between Application module and components are working effectively
System testing is testing the entire solution / application as a whole
acceptance testing is a kind of testing that checks for consistency with the users' specification and requirement


Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is a process of providing neccessary information to the model in order to get a quality and expected feedback while querying the ai model
It is important to use because it helps in fostering the desired feedback and solution without any ambiguity. 



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"What is a noun and give examples" is a vague prompt that will likely give a feedback that might not fully suit the users' expectation.

It can be improved by stating the role and considerations like: 
As a IDP teacher of a primary school, define what a noun is for a 4 to 5 years old pupils relating to their environment an African.
